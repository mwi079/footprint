# Footprint

## Puting everything I've learned so far on my coding journey together into something I'm passionate about.

In this application you input the details of a car journey and of your domestic electricity use and you'll be given your carbon footprint, as well as other useful information, for both. All unit conversions self coded to scratch my itch for problem solving.

## User instructions

A demo of this site can be seen at https://priceless-meitner-cc344e.netlify.app/
Alternatively, if you prefer to run locally, after download run "npm i2 in the root and then again in the client folder. Then run "npm start" in the client folder. 


## Tech Stack

- JavaScript
- React
- Material-UI
- Chart.JS

## APIs

- Vehicle data from https://www.fueleconomy.gov/feg/ws/
- UK Electricity Generation data from https://api.carbonintensity.org.uk/

**Further work**

- Find and use a more global API for domestic electricity carbon footprint (currently limited to UK post codes)
- Add a backend and authentication to track their footprint over time
